    summary: |
      I am a Bachelor student in the Ionian University in the island of Corfu studying Computer Science. 
      My interests are in Web Developing, Marketing, Photography and Nature. I am a very cooperative person, 
      as I have offered my help on two volunteering teams so far and many more for the university's assignments.
      I always ensure my work to be efficient, clean and aesthetically decent.
